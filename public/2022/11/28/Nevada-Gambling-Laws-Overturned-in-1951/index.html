        <h1 id="Nevada-Gambling-Laws-Overturned-in-1951"><a href="#Nevada-Gambling-Laws-Overturned-in-1951" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gambling Laws Overturned in 1951"></a>Nevada Gambling Laws Overturned in 1951</h1><p>On July 1, 1951, the Nevada gambling laws were overturned in a unanimous decision by the Nevada Supreme Court. This landmark case opened up the floodgates for casino gambling in Las Vegas and other parts of the state.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was brought by Benny Binion, owner of the Horseshoe Club in downtown Las Vegas. Binion had been arrested and charged with operating a gambling establishment without a license. However, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that because gambling was legal in other parts of the state, it should be legal in Las Vegas as well.</p>
<p>This ruling set off a gambling boom in Nevada that continues to this day. In fact, according to a study conducted by UNLV, casino gambling accounts for more than one-third of the state’s total economy.</p>
<p>The Nevada gaming industry has also been a major contributor to the local economy. In 2015, gaming industry employees earned more than $1 billion in wages and paid nearly $300 million in taxes.</p>
<p>The overturning of Nevada’s gambling laws was a major turning point in the history of Las Vegas and the state of Nevada as a whole. It paved the way for casino gaming to become one of the largest industries in the state and has had a significant impact on the local economy.</p>
<h1 id="How-Vegas-Became-the-Gambling-Capital-of-the-World"><a href="#How-Vegas-Became-the-Gambling-Capital-of-the-World" class="headerlink" title="How Vegas Became the Gambling Capital of the World"></a>How Vegas Became the Gambling Capital of the World</h1><p>Las Vegas has a long and colorful history, dating back to the early days of the American West. Originally a small outpost known as Fort Buenaventura, the area experienced a population and economic boom after settlers discovered silver in the surrounding hills in 1859. The city soon became known as a lawless town controlled by outlaws and desperadoes, and earned its notorious reputation as the “Gambling Capital of the World”.</p>
<p>While gambling has always been popular in Las Vegas, it wasn’t until 1931 that casino gaming was legalized. This led to a massive expansion of the city’s casino industry, with new resorts popping up all over town. In 1955, Bugsy Siegel opened The Flamingo, which is generally considered to be the first modern casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The city continued to grow rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, thanks in large part to its newly legalized gambling industry. In 1967, Howard Hughes purchased the Desert Inn, which is often cited as one of the most important moments in Las Vegas history. Hughes subsequently began investing heavily in the city’s casinos and hotels, helping to cement Las Vegas’s position as a world-class tourist destination.</p>
<p>Today, Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations on earth. With its glamorous casinos and hotels, 24-hour nightlife, and endless array of entertainment options, it’s no wonder that more than 40 million people visit each year. Thanks to its rich history and legendary culture, Las Vegas is sure to remain one of the world’s most popular destinations for years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Comes-to-Las-Vegas-–-A-Look-Back-at-the-History"><a href="#Gambling-Comes-to-Las-Vegas-–-A-Look-Back-at-the-History" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Comes to Las Vegas – A Look Back at the History"></a>Gambling Comes to Las Vegas – A Look Back at the History</h1><p>The early 1900s were an important time for Las Vegas. While it was first founded in 1905, it wasn’t until gambling was legalized in 1931 that the city began to boom. Since then, Las Vegas has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Let’s take a look back at the history of gambling in Las Vegas and some of the iconic casinos that have helped make it so famous.</p>
<p>The beginning</p>
<p>Las Vegas owes its existence to gambling. In 1905, a small settlement was established about 160km northeast of Los Angeles called Las Vegas Rancho. The area was chosen because of its proximity to the railroad and its natural springs, which were believed to have healing properties. However, the Rancho never really took off and by 1911 it had been abandoned.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1931 that things began to change. That year, Nevada became the only state in America that allowed gambling and casinos began sprouting up all over Las Vegas. The first casino to open in Las Vegas was The El Rancho Vegas on April 3, 1941.</p>
<p>The Rat Pack</p>
<p>In the 1950s, casinos started to attract Hollywood stars such as Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. This group of entertainers – known as “The Rat Pack” – would often perform at casinos in Las Vegas and became closely associated with them. In fact, Sinatra even had his own casino called The Sands which opened in 1952.</p>
<p>The 1970s and 1980s</p>
<p>By the 1970s, Las Vegas had become a global hotspot for gambling and tourism. Casinos were popping up faster than ever before and new attractions were being added all the time. In 1973, The Excalibur opened – Europe’s first themed hotel/casino complex. And in 1979, MGM Grand became the largest hotel in the world with 5400 rooms.</p>
<p>The 1990s onwards</p>
<p>Since 1990, Las Vegas has continued to grow rapidly with new hotels and casinos being built all the time. One of the biggest changes to occur during this period was the rise of online gaming and poker sites which allowed people from all over the world to play casino games from their homes.</p>
<h1 id="The-Year-Gambling-Came-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#The-Year-Gambling-Came-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="The Year Gambling Came to Las Vegas"></a>The Year Gambling Came to Las Vegas</h1><p>The first legal casino in Las Vegas was the “Irving” which opened in 1906. It offered nickel slots and games of chance such as Faro and Chuck-A-Luck. Gambling was considered a vice and was not condoned by mainstream society. This began to change in the 1930s when mobster Bugsy Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. The Flamingo was a huge success and other casinos followed.</p>
<p>Gambling became more popular in Las Vegas in the 1950s. This was due, in part, to the introduction of slot machines. In 1955, there were just over 1,000 slot machines in Las Vegas. By 1965, there were over 25,000 slot machines. Slot machines are now a staple of the Las Vegas casino experience.</p>
<p>The popularity of gambling in Las Vegas led to the development of new types of gambling games. In the 1960s, blackjack dealers started using signals to indicate when they had a good hand. This led to the development of blackjack strategy charts. Craps players also developed strategies for avoiding losing streaks.</p>
<p>Gambling continued to grow in popularity in Las Vegas throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The Mirage Casino, which opened in 1989, was a major turning point for the industry. The Mirage introduced luxurious amenities and attractions that were previously unseen in Las Vegas casinos. This led to a wave of new casino development in Las Vegas and helped make gambling an American institution.</p>
<h1 id="When-Gambling-Was-Legalized-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#When-Gambling-Was-Legalized-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="When Gambling Was Legalized in Las Vegas"></a>When Gambling Was Legalized in Las Vegas</h1><p>In 1931, gambling was legalized in Las Vegas. It was seen as a way to increase tourism and bring new money into the city. At the time, gambling was only legal in Nevada and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Las Vegas quickly became the gambling capital of the United States. Casinos were built on the Strip and downtown. Gambling became an important part of the city’s economy.</p>
<p>Las Vegas experienced a boom in tourism. People came from all over to gamble in Las Vegas. The city’s economy grew and it became a major destination for people looking for excitement.</p>
<p>However, with the legalization of gambling also came organized crime. The Mafia quickly moved in to take control of the casinos. They used violence and intimidation to keep people in line.</p>
<p>The early days of gambling in Las Vegas were not without controversy. There were concerns about the impact it was having on the city and its residents. However, ultimately, gambling was legalized and it has become an important part of Las Vegas’ culture and economy.</p>
