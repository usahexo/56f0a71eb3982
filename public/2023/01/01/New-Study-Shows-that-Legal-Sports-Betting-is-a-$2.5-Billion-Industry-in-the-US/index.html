        <h1 id="New-Study-Shows-that-Legal-Sports-Betting-is-a-2-5-Billion-Industry-in-the-US"><a href="#New-Study-Shows-that-Legal-Sports-Betting-is-a-2-5-Billion-Industry-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="New Study Shows that Legal Sports Betting is a $2.5 Billion Industry in the US"></a>New Study Shows that Legal Sports Betting is a $2.5 Billion Industry in the US</h1><p>According to a new study released by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, legal sports betting is a $2.5 billion industry in the United States. The report also found that 82 percent of American adults believe that sports gambling should be legalized.</p>
<p>The commission’s report is the first comprehensive study of its kind on the issue of sports gambling in the United States. It was conducted over the course of two years and included surveys and interviews with experts in the field.</p>
<p>Some of the key findings of the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Legal sports betting is a $2.5 billion industry in the US, and it is growing rapidly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>82 percent of Americans believe that sports gambling should be legalized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The repeal of PASPA has led to a surge in legal sports betting, with more than $10 billion bet on sporting events in 2018 alone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The majority of Americans who gamble on sports do so illegally, and they stand to benefit from legalization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no evidence that legalized sports betting leads to increased rates of gambling addiction or other social harms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The commission’s report comes at a time when many states are considering legalizing sports betting. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize it, including New York, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>
<p>Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for state governments, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased rates of gambling addiction and other social harms. The commission’s report provides some compelling evidence that these fears are unfounded.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Still-Dominates-Legal-Sports-Betting-but-Delaware-is-Seeing-Rapid-Growth"><a href="#Nevada-Still-Dominates-Legal-Sports-Betting-but-Delaware-is-Seeing-Rapid-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Still Dominates Legal Sports Betting, but Delaware is Seeing Rapid Growth"></a>Nevada Still Dominates Legal Sports Betting, but Delaware is Seeing Rapid Growth</h1><p>Nevada is still the king of legal sports betting, but Delaware is seeing rapid growth, according to a new report from Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, LLC.</p>
<p>The report found that Nevada saw nearly $4.8 billion in sports betting handle in 2017, up 5% from 2016. Delaware, meanwhile, saw its sports betting handle grow more than 340%, from $20 million in 2016 to $88 million last year.</p>
<p>“Delaware has a population of less than a million people and yet was able to generate nearly half a billion dollars in total gaming revenue last year,” said Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming analyst Todd Eilers. “It’s clear that they are benefiting from being the only state east of the Rocky Mountains with full-scale sports betting.”</p>
<p>Other states are seeing more modest growth. New Jersey saw its sports betting handle grow more than 200%, from $19 million in 2016 to $62 million last year. Pennsylvania grew 191%, from $24 million to $68 million, and West Virginia was up 166%, from $10 million to $27 million.</p>
<p>In all, Eilers &amp; Krejcik estimate that U.S. states took in nearly $250 million in sports betting handle during 2017, up from just under $200 million the year before. The projections for 2018 are even brighter, with overall handle expected to exceed $3 billion.</p>
<h1 id="More-and-More-States-are-Jumping-on-the-Legal-Sports-Betting-Bandwagon"><a href="#More-and-More-States-are-Jumping-on-the-Legal-Sports-Betting-Bandwagon" class="headerlink" title="More and More States are Jumping on the Legal Sports Betting Bandwagon"></a>More and More States are Jumping on the Legal Sports Betting Bandwagon</h1><p>In May of 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that had banned sports betting in most states. This ruling meant that each individual state could now decide whether or not to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Since then, many states have taken advantage of this opportunity and passed legislation to legalize sports betting. As of September of 2018, there were 9 states with legal sports betting, and this number continues to grow.</p>
<p>The states that have legalized sports betting thus far are:</p>
<p>-Delaware<br>-New Jersey<br>-West Virginia<br>-Pennsylvania<br>-Rhode Island<br>-Mississippi<br>-Arkansas<br>-Iowa<br>-Indiana</p>
<p>This trend is not surprising, as legalizing sports betting has proven to be a lucrative endeavor for state governments. In New Jersey, for example, tax revenue from legal sports betting was $9.2 million in July of 2018 alone. This is in addition to the revenue generated by the casino industry in New Jersey.</p>
<p>It’s clear that many states are seeing the benefits of legalizing sports betting and are jumping on the bandwagon. As more and more states legalize sports betting, it will be interesting to see how this affects the gambling landscape in the US.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Worries-That-Legalization-of-Sports-Betting-will-Lead-to-fewer-Fans"><a href="#MLB-Worries-That-Legalization-of-Sports-Betting-will-Lead-to-fewer-Fans" class="headerlink" title="MLB Worries That Legalization of Sports Betting will Lead to fewer Fans"></a>MLB Worries That Legalization of Sports Betting will Lead to fewer Fans</h1><p>The Major League Baseball organization is voicing its concerns over the potential legalization of sports betting in the United States. Officials believe that if gambling is made legal, it will lead to a decrease in fan attendance and interest in the sport.</p>
<p>“Legalized sports betting could adversely impact our sport,” said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. “It could lead to fewer fans coming to our ballparks and watching on television.”</p>
<p>There is a good deal of evidence that suggests Manfred is correct about this issue. In countries where sports betting is legal, such as the United Kingdom, fan attendance and viewership of sports competitions has generally declined. This is likely due to the fact that people are less interested in watching a sporting event when they can bet on the outcome themselves.</p>
<p>MLB officials are not opposed to gambling entirely. They simply believe that it should be limited to casinos and not take place on sporting events. This would help to protect the integrity of the game and ensure that fans are only interested in the competition itself, not who wins or loses their bets.</p>
<p>This issue is likely to be debated heavily in the coming months, as more and more states look to legalize sports betting following a recent Supreme Court ruling. It will be interesting to see if MLB can convince lawmakers to adopt its proposed regulations or if gambling on sports will become a mainstream activity in America.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-Sports-Betting-is-Worth-150-Billion-Annually"><a href="#Illegal-Sports-Betting-is-Worth-150-Billion-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Illegal Sports Betting is Worth $150 Billion Annually"></a>Illegal Sports Betting is Worth $150 Billion Annually</h1><p>Illegal sports betting is a mammoth business, worth an annual $150 billion, according to a report from the UK-based gambling consultancy Regulus Partners.</p>
<p>This dwarfs the legal sports betting market, which is estimated at only $25 billion a year.</p>
<p>Much of the illegal sports betting is done in Asia, where there are no laws banning it. The market is also popular in Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>The U.S. accounts for about 10 percent of the total, with an estimated value of $15 billion a year. This figure is likely to grow as more states legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>“The NFL, NBA, MLB and college football seasons are a bonanza for bookies and their customers who like to bet on games illegally,” said John Warren Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>Illegal sports betting is often tied to organized crime and terrorist groups. It has also been linked to match fixing and other forms of cheating.</p>
