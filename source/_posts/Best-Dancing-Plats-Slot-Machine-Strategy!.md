#  How to Beat the Dancing Plats Slot Machine - Guaranteed!

There’s no question that the Dancing Plats slot machine is one of the most popular games at any casino. It’s also one of the most difficult to beat, with a house edge of over 7%. However, there are a few simple strategies that you can use to help improve your odds and have a better chance of walking away a winner.
