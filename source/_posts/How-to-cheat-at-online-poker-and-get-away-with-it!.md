#  How to cheat at online poker and get away with it!

You've probably heard the saying that poker is a game of 100% skill and 0% chance.

And while it's true that good players will beat bad players over time, there's always an element of luck involved in any given hand.

Which means that, just like in any other casino game, there's potential for cheating.

In this article, we'll take a look at some of the ways you can cheat at online poker and get away with it!

## collusion
One of the most common forms of cheating in online poker is collusion. This is where two or more players work together to advantage themselves over the other players at the table.

Collusion can involve anything from sharing information about hands to actually conspiring to split up pots between them.

Obviously, collusion is a very risky strategy and can easily backfire if caught. But if executed correctly, it can be very effective in winning money from unsuspecting opponents.

## card counting
Card counting is another popular form of cheating in online poker. This involves keeping track of the percentage of high value cards (10s, jacks, queens and kings) that have been played so far in order to gain an advantage over your opponents.

By knowing when the deck is "loaded" in favour of high value cards, you can make better decisions about which hands to play and increase your chances of winning.

Card counting is a complex technique, but there are plenty of online resources available to help you learn how to do it properly.

#  The only guide to cheating at online poker without getting caught!

There are a lot of ways to cheat at online poker, but some are more risky than others. Here is a guide on how to cheat at online poker without getting caught!

## The safest way to cheat at online poker

The safest way to cheat at online poker is by using a remote colluder. This is a device that you can use to collude with another player without being in the same room. This is a great way to cheat because there is no way for the other players or the casino to know what you are doing.

To use a remote colluder, you need two devices: one that you will use to play the game and one that you will use to control the game. The device that you will use to play the game needs an internet connection so that it can send information to the controller device. The controller device can be any type of computer or mobile phone.

Once you have your devices set up, you need to create a collusion account. This is an account that you and your partner will use to communicate with each other during the game. You can create this account on any website or app that allows text messaging.

Once your accounts are set up, it’s time to start cheating! During the game, your controller device will send messages to your collusion account telling you what cards your partner has and what cards they are betting on. This information will help you make better decisions during the game and give you an advantage over the other players.

Keep in mind that using a remote colluder is not 100% safe. There is always a chance that someone could catch on to what you are doing or that the casino could ban your account. However, if used correctly, a remote colluder can be a great way to cheat at online poker without getting caught!

#  How to cheat on online poker like a pro!

The internet has made it easier than ever for people to gamble and poker is no exception. However, even though it may be easy to find a game, it's not always easy to win. So if you're looking to take your poker skills to the next level, here are a few tips on how to cheat on online poker like a pro!

First of all, you'll need to find an online poker site that doesn't have any anti-cheating measures in place. There are a few sites like this out there, but they're getting harder and harder to find. Once you've found a site that you can trust, you'll need to start learning the tells of your opponents.

Every player has certain tells that give away their hand. For example, when a player is bluffing they might start sweating or blinking more than usual. Other clues that someone might be bluffing include raising their voice or betting aggressively. So once you've identified some of your opponent's tells, you can start using them to your advantage.

Another way to cheat on online poker is by using bots. Bots are computer programs that can play poker for you and they're becoming increasingly sophisticated. So if you're looking for an edge over your opponents, using bots is a great way to do it.

Finally, one of the best ways to cheat on online poker is by using VPNs. A VPN allows you to spoof your location and make it look like you're playing from another country. This can be very useful if the site you're playing on restricts access from certain countries. So if you want to increase your chances of winning, using a VPN is a great way to do it.
