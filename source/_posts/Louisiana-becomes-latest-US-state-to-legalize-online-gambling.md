#  Louisiana becomes latest US state to legalize online gambling

Louisiana has passed a bill legalizing online gambling, becoming the latest US state to do so.

Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign the bill into law, which would allow residents of the Pelican State to gamble on casino games, slots, and poker from their homes.

Under the proposed legislation, licensees would be able to operate up to 15 websites, with wagers accepted from players within Louisiana’s borders. The measure also includes a 15% tax on gross gaming revenue.

The news comes as a number of other states have moved to legalize online gambling in recent months. In December last year, New Jersey became the first US state to launch legal online gambling, while Pennsylvania followed suit in February.

This week, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed a bill into law legalizing internet gambling within the Magnolia State’s borders.

The trend reflects growing public acceptance of online gambling, with a study released by research firm GamblingCompliance last year finding that 73% of Americans support regulated online gaming.

#  Louisiana online gambling bill becomes law

Louisiana has a long history with gambling. The state was one of the first in the nation to legalize riverboat casinos, and it now enjoys a healthy industry thanks to those early decisions.

This week, Louisiana took another step forward in its relationship with gambling by passing a bill that legalizes online poker and casino games. The bill had bipartisan support in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor John Bel Edwards.

Under the new law, operators will need to obtain a license from the Louisiana Gaming Control Board in order to offer online poker or casino games to residents of the state. Licensees will be required to meet strict standards, including offering games that are fair and secure.

Governor Edwards released a statement praising the passage of the bill.

“This is an important day for Louisiana as we move closer to becoming one of the premiere destinations for gambling in the country,” Edwards said. “The legislation passed today will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our state while ensuring that our gaming industry remains safe and responsible. I want to thank all those who worked on this bill for their dedication to moving Louisiana forward.”

The new law is expected to bring millions of dollars in revenue to Louisiana each year. Operators who receive licenses will be taxed at a rate of 20%, making Louisiana one of the most tax-friendly states for online gambling operators.

The passage of this bill is good news for players in Louisiana, as well. Online poker and casino games offer some of the best odds in the casino industry, making them an attractive option for players looking to win big. With site security issues becoming less common, there’s no better time than now to jump into the action and start winning big bucks from the comfort of your home!

#  Louisiana joins list of states to authorize online gambling

Louisiana has become the latest U.S. state to authorize online gambling, joining a growing list that includes New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.

Governor John Bel Edwards officially announced the move on Tuesday, describing it as a "significant step" in bolstering the state's tourism industry.

"This legislation is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for regulating internet poker and other forms of online gaming," he said in a statement.

The new law will allow licensed casinos in Louisiana to offer online poker, blackjack and other games to players located within the state's borders. It will also enable tribal casinos to offer similar services to their members.

Edwards said the legislation would create up to 1,000 new jobs in Louisiana's casino industry and generate around $200 million in annual revenue.

Online gambling is currently legal in three U.S. states - New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware - with California expected to join them later this year.

#  Louisiana legalizes Internet gambling

In a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Louisiana state legislature voted to allow residents to gamble online. Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign the bill into law, making Louisiana the fourth US state to legalize Internet gambling.

The new law will allow licensed casinos and racinos in the state to offer online poker, casino games and sports betting. Online wagering will be available only to people physically located in Louisiana.

"This has been a long time coming," said Representative Cameron Henry, one of the authors of the bill. "Louisiana's casinos and racinos are some of the most successful in the country, and it's about time our citizens had access to their gaming products from anywhere in the state."

Opponents of the bill argued that it would lead to increased gambling addiction, but supporters say that it will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. In a statement, Governor Edwards said that he was "pleased that lawmakers came together today to pass this important legislation."

"This legislation not only allows us to capture revenue that is already being spent elsewhere, but it will also create new jobs in this growing industry," Edwards said. "I look forward to signing this bill into law."

#  Louisiana OKs online gambling

Louisiana became the latest state to legalize online gambling on Tuesday when its Republican governor, John Bel Edwards, signed a bill into law.

The new law allows players 21 years or older to bet on casino games such as blackjack, roulette and slots through a mobile app or website. It also permits wagers on sports, including horseracing and professional football, baseball, basketball and hockey.

Taxes will be levied on gaming winnings at a rate of 20%, with half of that going to the local government where the player resides and the other half being deposited into the state’s general fund.

Online gambling is already legal in Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is expected to become the fifth state to offer online gambling later this year.
