#  Raging Bull Casino Owner Plans to Spin the Roulette Wheel in Style

The eccentric casino mogul and owner of the Raging Bull casino in Las Vegas, Fred DeLuca, has announced plans to build a new, extravagant luxury hotel on the site of his casino. The hotel will be a high-end affair, with all the amenities one would expect from a top-tier property, from plush rooms and suites to world-class restaurants and lounges.

But it's not just the accommodations that will be extraordinary; the casino floor itself is set to be a lavish spectacle. DeLuca has revealed that he plans to install a huge roulette wheel right in the middle of the action, giving players an up-close and personal view of all the spinning excitement.

"There's nothing like seeing those little white balls bouncing around and spinning around," DeLuca enthused in a recent interview. "It's got all the drama of a movie set, and I think my guests are going to love it."

In addition to the roulette wheel, DeLuca also plans to bring in some of Europe's best casino croupiers to staff his new property. These professionals will be on hand to help players make the most of their gaming experience, and ensure that everyone has a thrilling time.

For those who want to take a break from gambling, there will also be plenty of other activities available on site. The hotel's spa is sure to be popular, as will its infinity pool with stunning views of the Las Vegas skyline. And for those who want to explore beyond the property boundaries, downtown Las Vegas is just a short cab ride away.

DeLuca is confident that his new hotel will be a hit with visitors from all over the world. "I've put together a team of experts who know how to create an unforgettable experience," he said. "I can't wait for people to see what we have in store."
