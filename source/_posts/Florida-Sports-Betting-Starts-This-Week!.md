#  Florida Sports Betting Starts This Week!

It was announced late last week that the state of Florida will finally allow sports betting starting this Wednesday, October 17th. The news came as a surprise to many, as the state had originally been resistant to sports betting legalization.

However, with the recently passed US Supreme Court ruling that allows states to legalize sports betting if they choose, Florida has decided to get in on the action. There are currently few details available about how the sports betting process will work in Florida, but we can expect more information to be released in the coming days.

Some estimates suggest that the Florida gambling market could be worth up to $2.5 billion per year, so there is certainly a lot of potential for profit in this new industry. Several major casinos and racetracks have already expressed interest in getting into the sports betting game, so it should be interesting to see who comes out on top.

It's still unclear how much tax revenue Florida expects to generate from sports betting, but it's likely that this will be a significant source of income for the state. It's also possible that this could lead to an increase in tourism, as people flock to Florida to place bets on their favorite teams.

All things considered, it looks like Florida is finally ready to join the rest of the country in legalizing sports betting. This should be good news for casino operators and gamblers alike, as there is now another way to enjoy gambling in the Sunshine State.

#   sports fans rejoice, betting begins in Florida this week!

In what is seen as a major victory for sports fans and the state of Florida, legalized sports betting begins this week. This makes the state one of the first in the nation to offer legal sports betting outside of Nevada.

The new law allows bets to be placed on professional and collegiate sporting events, with some restrictions on what types of bets are available. Bettors can make single-game wagers and parlay bets, but cannot bet on proposition or futures odds.

This week’s biggest game? The NFL’s Super Bowl LIII matchup between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. Bettors can place their bets at any of the state’s casinos or racetracks, which are all licenced to offer sports betting.

While there is much excitement surrounding the launch of legal sports betting in Florida, some are still cautious about its effects. One worry is that it could lead to increased cases of gambling addiction. However, proponents of legalized sports betting say that it will bring more money into the state, and that regulations can help protect people from addiction.

So far, it looks like early interest in legalized sports betting in Florida is high. At least four casinos have reported that they have taken more than $1 million in wagers in just the first few days since betting began.

#  Florida's first legal sports bet is a winner

The Miami Dolphins’ upset victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday was a boon for Florida sportsbooks, with more than $1.5 million in wagers placed on the game.

While it’s uncertain how much of that action came from legal betting, the debut of sports betting in the Sunshine State was a success by all accounts.

“It was amazing,” said Rachelle Brioche, a cashier at the Hard Rock casino in Hollywood,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Fla. “We had lines out the door all day.”

Brioche said that the casino took in about $200,000 in wagers on the game. That’s far less than what took place in Nevada last weekend – where legal sports betting has been around for years – but it was a strong start for Florida.

Florida lawmakers legalized sports betting late last year, and six casinos were authorized to offer it starting Sunday. The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported that four of those casinos accepted bets on the Dolphins-Patriots game, with handle sizes ranging from $10,000 at Daytona Downs to $300,000 at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Hollywood.

In addition to football, bettors could also wager on basketball and baseball games. The News-Journal quoted John Partridge, president of Sportradar US, as saying that “the market is definitely there” for legal sports betting in Florida.

That’s good news for state coffers; according to estimates cited by Reuters in December, legalizing sports betting could bring in more than $100 million per year in tax revenue.

#  Big day for Florida sports betting fans as sites open

The wait is over as sports betting sites opened in the state of Florida on Monday. This was great news for many fans of sports betting, who were looking forward to having more options when it came to placing bets.

There were some initial delays with some of the sites, but things seemed to be running smoothly by the afternoon. The most popular site on day one was undoubtedly DraftKings, which saw a lot of action thanks to its generous promotions.

Other sites that received a lot of traffic included PointsBet and BetDNA, both of which offer some unique features that Sports fans are sure to love. There will no doubt be some growing pains in the early days, but things are looking good for the future of Florida sports betting.

One thing that is for sure is that this opening has been long awaited by many people in the state. With so much action taking place on day one, it’s clear that Florida sports betting is going to be a big hit!

#  Ready to bet on your favorite Florida team? Here's where to do it legally

Bets on college and professional sports are big business in the United States. In Florida, there are a few different ways that you can legally make a bet on your favorite team.

If you want to bet with a friend or acquaintance, you can do so without any legal issues as long as the bet is for something of insignificant value, such as a few beers or some snacks.

However, if you want to place a larger wager with a bookie or at a casino, then you will need to do so through one of the state's licensed gambling operators. This includes entities like horse and dog tracks, poker rooms, and casinos.

Florida has been slow to embrace legal sports betting, but that looks likely to change in the near future. A bill that would legalize sports betting statewide was introduced in the Florida legislature in early 2019. If this bill is passed, it will be interesting to see how the various gambling operators in the state adjust their offerings.
