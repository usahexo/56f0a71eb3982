#  Liverpool FC unbeaten in their last 5 confrontations!

Liverpool FC hasn't lost a single match in their last 5 confrontations! Jürgen Klopp's side has been on an amazing run, scoring 16 goals and conceding only 3. Their most recent victory came against Southampton on Wednesday, where they won 2-0 thanks to goals by Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino.

It wasn't always easy for the Reds, as they had to come back from behind in both matches against Burnley and Swansea City. They also needed late goals to secure wins against Leicester City and Southampton. But that proves they are a team that never gives up, and now they are on a roll that could see them finish in the top 4 of the Premier League.

Their next challenge will be Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium. Spurs have had an inconsistent season, but they still pose a threat to Liverpool. If the Reds can win this match, it will be another sign that they are capable of challenging for the title next season.

#  Liverpool take on Man City in a crucial confront card match!

Liverpool come into this match having won their last two matches, while Manchester City have won their last three. Liverpool will be looking to avenge their only loss of the season, which came at the hands of Manchester City.

Manchester City will be looking to extend their winning streak, as they hope to overtake Liverpool and take first place in the Premier League. This game is sure to be full of goals and excitement, so make sure to tune in!

#  Lovren: A point against Manchester City is like a victory!

September 21, 2018

Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren has claimed that a point against Manchester City is like a victory. The Croatian international played the full 90 minutes as Liverpool were held to a 0-0 draw by reigning Premier League champions Manchester City at Anfield on Saturday.

Since the arrivals of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker, Lovren has found himself out of the starting lineup, but he made a good case for himself with an impressive performance against Pep Guardiola’s side. “It was very difficult but I think it is like a victory when you play against Manchester City and you don’t concede any goals. We were unlucky in some moments – like in the first half when we hit the post – but I am really happy with the team and how we played,” Lovren told reporters after the game.

The 29-year-old was also full of praise for new goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who made some important saves to keep Liverpool in the game. “Alisson is a great goalkeeper and he showed that again today. He is calm on the ball and that is very important for us defenders because it gives us more confidence when we can play from the back. He is a very good signing for Liverpool,” Lovren said.

Liverpool will now turn their attention to their Champions League group stage opener against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night.

#  Klopp: I'm not sure what a confront card is, but we'll try and win anyway! 

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted he doesn't know what a confront card is, but promised his side would still try and win the game.

The German was responding to comments from Merseyside rival Everton boss Ronald Koeman that Liverpool had been lucky in their two wins against his side this season, and that they would need to be careful not to get 'a confrontation card'.

"I have no idea what a confront card is," laughed Klopp, "but we'll try and win anyway."

Koeman's comments came after a meeting of the Premier League managers earlier this week, where a number of issues were raised including diving, simulation and player behaviour.

Everton are currently one place above Liverpool in the table, with 43 points to the Reds' 42.

#  Can Liverpool extend their undefeated streak against top-6 teams with a confront card victory over Man City?

Liverpool are in the midst of their best ever start to a Premier League season. Unbeaten in their first twelve games, they now sit just two points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, and with a game in hand. Most recently, they dispatched Burnley 5-0 away from home, with Sadio Mane netting twice and Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Xherdan Shaqiri also getting on the scoresheet.

Their next test comes in the form of a home game against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side. Liverpool have not lost against a top-six team since January 2017, but this will undoubtedly be their toughest test yet. Liverpool’s front three of Mane, Salah and Firmino have been in scintillating form this season, contributing 30 goals between them already. If they can continue this form against City, then Liverpool will have a real chance of picking up all three points.

City come into the game having won their last six Premier League games, most recently beating Southampton 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium. They currently sit second in the table, four points behind Liverpool but with a game in hand. Sergio Aguero is in excellent form this season, scoring twelve league goals so far. However, Guardiola may opt to play Gabriel Jesus up front instead after he came off the bench to score twice against Southampton.

It should be an excellent game of football, and it will be interesting to see if Liverpool can extend their unbeaten streak against top-six teams.
