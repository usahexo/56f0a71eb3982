#  Albert Einstein's Favorite Sip is a Winner at the Casino!

In what may have been the smartest decision of his life, Albert Einstein was known to enjoy a good glass of iced tea while gambling at the casino. And it seems his smarts paid off - at least when it came to his favourite drink!

In an interview with the magazine "GQ" in 2009, physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson revealed that Einstein's favoured drink was in fact iced tea. Dyson claims that not only did the great thinker love the taste of the drink, but he would also strategically place himself at a casino table where iced tea was available so he could refresh himself between rounds.

It would seem that Einstein's theory of relativity also applied to his casino game strategy - giving him a winning edge on the competition! Who would have thought that iced tea could be so important?

While we can't guarantee that enjoying a cold drink will help you win big bucks at the casino, we can say with certainty that iced tea is a delicious and refreshing choice on a hot day. So why not give it a try next time you're feeling lucky?

#  The Best Drink to Order at an Online Casino - According to Albert Einstein 

Water is the best drink to order at an online casino, according to Albert Einstein. The renowned physicist and mathematician once said, "Water is the best of all drinks, and tea is second best."

There's a lot of truth to this statement, especially when it comes to playing at online casinos. Water is a refreshing and hydrating drink that can help keep you alert and focused while playing your favorite casino games. It's also calorie-free and low in carbs, making it a great choice for those who are watching their waistlines.

Tea is another great drink to order at an online casino. Not only does it hydrate you, but it also has antioxidant properties that can help protect your body against free radicals. Tea also contains caffeine, which can help increase your energy levels and keep you alert while playing.

If you're looking for a slightly sweetened beverage to enjoy while playing at an online casino, consider ordering a diet soft drink or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice. These drinks are low in calories and carbs, and they won't interfere with your gameplay.

Avoid ordering sugary drinks like sodas or fruit juices when playing at an online casino. These beverages can make you feel lethargic and sluggish, which is the last thing you want when trying to win big prizes.
